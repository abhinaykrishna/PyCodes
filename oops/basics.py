# WeCare insurance company wants to calculate premium of vehicles.
# Vehicles are of two types â€“ "Two Wheeler" and "Four Wheeler". Each vehicle is identified by vehicle id, type, cost and premium amount.
# Premium amount is 2% of the vehicle cost for two wheeler and 6% of the vehicle cost for four wheeler. Calculate the premium amount and display the vehicle details.
# Write a Python program to implement the class chosen with its attributes and methods.
# Note:
# 1. Display appropriate error message, if the vehicle type is invalid
# 2. Perform case sensitive string comparison

# Represent few customers, invoke purchases() method and display the details.
